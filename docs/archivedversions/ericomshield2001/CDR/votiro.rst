Votiro (On-Premise)
*******************

Ericom Shield can integrate with Votiro (on-premise) CDR solution installed (with or w/o the Management).

For Shield to integrate with this CDR solution, it needs to be defined in the Administration Console with all relevant settings filled in.

Modify the ``File Sanitization Primary URL`` to point to the Votiro server. Define the secondary URL if desired.

Expand the Votiro Named Policies subsection. It is possible to use this solution with the default named policy mapped to Shield (named **Votiro(Def)**, included in the table by 
default) or define additional named policies. For more information, go `here <../deploymentguide/FAQ/namedpolicies.html>`_.
