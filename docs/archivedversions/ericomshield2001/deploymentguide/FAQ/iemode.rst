How To Work With IE Mode
************************

.. note:: This is a **Tech-Preview** feature. This feature is available only if the ``Settings | General`` - **Enable Tech-Preview Features** is set to Yes.

Shield browsers use the latest browsing technology in various browsers (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera etc.).
Many legacy websites (e.g. governmental, financial, insurance etc.) include components that are available only in Internet Explorer based browsers (IE/Edge).
Unlike other solutions, these legacy websites are supported out-of-the-box in Shield and require configuration.
For websites that **must** be opened using IE/Edge browser (since on other browsers they are not fully-functional), Shield includes a dedicated Access mode.
In order for such websites to be available in Shield, follow these steps:

*   Define the domains in the Policies table and set the ``Access Policy`` to be **IE Mode**

*   Contact Ericom Shield Professional Services for further information
