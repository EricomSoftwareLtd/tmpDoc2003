Ericom Shield has the following key features:

* Enables users to browse the internet safely and securely while isolating the users’ machine and the internal network from threats of malware and ransomware.

* Can be deployed in various options, according to the customer's current network architecture. This includes both on premise and Cloud deployments, either exclusively or combined, including external browsers farm, external proxies, syslog servers etc.

* Completely Cloud-compliant. Full Cloud system deployment is supported, including auto-scaling of nodes and of browsers (when Browser Farm is in the Cloud).

* Seamless user experience with zero installation on the end point devices – users benefit from the same experience as a non-protected browser, but without the risks.

* Rich web based administration console. The administration console does not require any high maintenance plug-ins or installers.

* Includes a policy engine to allow administrators to easily manage which sites users can access, restrict access to downloading files, block cookies, access to clipboard and more.

* Ericom Shield helps eliminate the risks from weaponized documents. File downloads can be sanitized using Content Disarm and Reconstruct (CDR) and file type conversion sanitization methods.

* Scalable architecture - multiple shield servers can be easily implemented to allow for large scale deployments. Scaling can be done both horizontally and vertically. This ability also supports multi-site architecture.

* Efficient resources usage - Shield includes smart resources management. Unused remote browsers are removed to free up resources. Once required - new browsers are created again. 

* Administration console dashboard - highly useful and informative, displays current status of the system, resources, nodes, license information etc.

* User Authentication to prevent unwanted users connecting to the system's proxy. 

* Active Directory Profiles to allow easy configuration of domains per group of users. Support of very large Active Directories with thousands of groups and users.

* Reports - in the administration console dedicated section, based on data collected using Kibana and displayed in an informative manner. 

* Ericom Shield can be used with any browser that supports HTML5 (IE11, Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera).
