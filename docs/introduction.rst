What is Ericom ShieldÂ®? 
**********************


Ericom Shield is a remote isolated virtual browser solution. The actual browsing takes place in a secure, isolated container that has no access to the Local 
Area Network. The Ericom Shield deployment can be on premise in the DMZ or in the Cloud. Ericom Shield is managed via a web-based administration console.

Ericom Shield enables users to safely browse the internet while protecting the local machine and the network from any malicious code which may execute within 
the browser. In an event that malicious code is present in the page, it is contained and isolated within the container itself, therefore preventing infection 
of the local machine or network. When the session ends, the container is destroyed, and therefore any infection within the container is also destroyed.  

In addition, the Administrator has complete control over file downloads. Files can be either downloaded directly, fully sanitized, previewed only or completely blocked. 
This can be done per domain, category or profile. It is also possible to affect the entire system using the override policy option. 
When files are sanitized, the process occurs seamlessly in the background before the file is delivered to the user.

Ericom Shield can be used with a wide array of browsers. All that is required is to configure the device (browser) with the location of the Ericom proxy server.

Ericom Shield is deployed on Linux-based containers. Each browsing session starts in its own dedicated container. All sessions are routed by the Ericom Shield 
Proxy server, ensuring optimal resource allocation and high availability.
