Ericom Shield system comes with English (US) as the default language. Japanese is also officially supported. 
Other languages can be added to Shield, using the instructions detailed hereunder.

In this section of the Administration Console, it is possible to add new languages or to edit existing language files.

The language file contains all Administration Console strings (labels, messages, dialogs etc.) and all end user messages (notifications, status updates, CDR related messages etc.).

It is possible to select a language file as the Administration Console display language, as the End User language, or as both. To select, mark the desired checkbox at the top.

I.e., if the administration is in English, but the end users prefer French, select the EN language file as the Administration Console display language and the FR language file as the End User language.

Add New Language
==================

Click the ``Add New Language`` option on the top left of the toolbar.
Enter a name for the required language and the language locale and click save.

Select the **Admin Console/End User** language checkboxes, as desired. 
If the changes were made to a file defined as **Administration Console Language**, the file will be reloaded and changes will be effective immidiately.

The available languages are the ones defined in the admin.
All texts generated by Shield system are affected by the selected language, including errors, messages, status details etc. 
The selected language is kept locally for the end user and will affect current & future sessions.

Possible modifications are:
